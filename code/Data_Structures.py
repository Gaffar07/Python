# built in data structures
# 1)lists
# 2)sets
# 3)tuple
# 4)dict
#
# user defined data strctures
# array:only one datatype is allowed
# stack:made from arrays,follows lifo rule,have pointer called top
# queue:folow fifo rule,have pointer called head and tail
# linkedlist
# tree:are used too define the hierarchy
# graph


# 1)lists
# can have heterogenous data in it
# they are mutable

# 3)tuple
# faster than list
# immutable
