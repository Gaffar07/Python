# Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.
#
# Built-in Math Functions
# The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:
# x=min(1,2,3,4,5)
# print(x)

#The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:
#
# x=abs(-7.25)
# print(x)

#The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y (xy)

# x=pow(4,2)
# print(x)
import math

# x=math.sqrt(9)
# print(x)


#The math.ceil() method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer,
# and the math.floor() method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result:

x=math.ceil(1.5)
y=math.floor(1.5)

print(x)
print(y)

print(math.pi)
